      "content": "This burnt sugar caramel cake is a wonderfully sweet and buttery cake flavored with homemade burnt sugar syrup. The syrup combines caramelized sugar and water, a mixture you cook on the stove until itâ€™s dark amber in color. The cake does not taste burnt, bitter, or charred. Rather, it tastes like caramel and caramelized sugar, the same topping used for creme brÃ»lÃ©e! Weâ€™ll flavor the frosting with burnt sugar syrup as well. Inside the cake and frosting, the syrup tastes like caramel. In my experience, this is the only from-scratch caramel flavored addition that (1) provides flavor and (2) doesnâ€™t ruin the cakeâ€™s texture."

      "content": "I developed and published a pineapple upside down cake recipe several years ago. Itâ€™s certainly loved by many, but the cake is prone to overflowing because thereâ€™s quite a lot of batter. Additionally, it can taste overly wet and the instructions were never written very clearly. As a cookbook author and baker, Iâ€™ve certainly improved my craft over the years! Though I kept the original recipe written in the notes below, I want to share my new and improved version with you.My improved pineapple upside down cake recipe, written below, is much softer than my original. Using creamed butter instead of melted, cake flour instead of all-purpose flour, all white sugar instead of brown sugar + white, and using egg whites guarantees a huge textural difference. I adapted it from my white cake. Additionally, weâ€™ll skip the pineapple juice in the cake batter because it often produces a wet crumb. (Thereâ€™s plenty of pineapple flavor in the topping!) Finally, my new recipe doesnâ€™t yield as much cake batter, so we donâ€™t have to worry about overflowing."

      "content": "What is pavlova? Pavlova is a dessert popular in New Zealand and Australia. Itâ€™s not as common here in the states, but I hope to help change that! A texture freakâ€™s dream come true, pavlova is made from egg whites that are slowly baked in a relatively cool oven. The egg whites take on a chewy-crisp texture on top, a soft marshmallow texture inside, and a crunchy crisp texture around the edges. Thatâ€™s three completely different textures in one single bite. The crunchy edges are just like meringue cookies."

      "content": "Have I mentioned yet how easy these cookies are? Besides using super basic ingredients, the method couldnâ€™t be simpler. Whisk the butter, sugar, milk, and cocoa powder together in a medium (3 quart) pot until the butter melts. Once simmering around the edges, start a timer. Let it simmer for 1 minute. After that, immediately remove from heat and stir in the peanut butter and vanilla extract. Once combined, stir in the oats.Grab your timer again and let the mixture cool for 4-5 minutes. This gives the oats some time to absorb the liquid, which makes scooping and shaping much easier. If you used a super thin natural-style peanut butter, let it sit for about 10 minutes."

      "content": "I like to use Anjou (red or green), Bartletts (red or green), or Bosc pears in pie. To avoid a mushy filling, look for pears that are slightly firm. Your best bet is to purchase about 6-7 pears, then let them sit in a paper bag for 1-2 days to slightly ripen. Much longer than this and theyâ€™ll be too soft. Youâ€™ll only need about 5 pears for the pie, but I suggest picking up an extra in case any develop soft spots.Peel the pears, then cut them into (about) 1/2-inch chunks. Youâ€™ll mix the pears with sugar + cinnamon, and flour to thicken. A pinch of ground ginger adds that little something special, while a waterfall of caramel adds a BIG SOMETHING SPECIAL."

Am I allowed to admit that these are even better than the original? Ultra thin layers. Buttery crispness. Melted chocolate. Confectionersâ€™ sugar dusting. Simple. Decadent. Thereâ€™s absolutely nothing on earth better than a warm chocolate croissant unless that warm chocolate croissant was proudly handmade in your own kitchen."
