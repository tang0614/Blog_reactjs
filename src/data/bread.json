      "content": "These homemade garlic knots are extra soft and fluffy, made from my favorite 6 ingredient pizza dough, and are topped with flavorful garlic herb butter before AND after baking. Shaping is a breeze with my video tutorial and step-by-step pictures for visual help. This recipe is brought to you in partnership with Red Star Yeast.Iâ€™ve made these garlic knots 3x in the past month. Each batch yields 16 and thereâ€™s only 2 adults in this house. You do the math. (Ok ok, one night we had friends over for dinner but still.) These are the BEST garlic knots!!! Iâ€™m knot even kidding. ðŸ˜‰"

I challenge readers to a new recipe every month on or around the 1st, all filed under the category Sallyâ€™s Baking Challenge!Here we are 2 weeks later with a croissant variation. Am I allowed to admit that these are even better than the original? Ultra thin layers. Buttery crispness. Melted chocolate. Confectionersâ€™ sugar dusting. Simple. Decadent. Thereâ€™s absolutely nothing on earth better than a warm chocolate croissant unless that warm chocolate croissant was proudly handmade in your own kitchen."
